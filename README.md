# fx-statistics

A Firefox add-on that works with data from the native ```about:memory``` page in the browser.

---

### What you get
* A new internal page for your browser, ```about:stats```
* A toolbar-button in the browser's chrome, for quick and easy access to the statistics

---

### What's on offer
* ##### Live Updates 
Data is pulled in real time from the ```about:memory``` backend. If that is not your cup of tea, you can disable live updates, which would reveal the option to manually update the numbers.

* ##### Back-in-time Statistics
A time slider is provided, which would allow you to track the statistics through the displayed datasets. Track your improvements or mistakes in time.

* ##### Browser's Internal Statistics
Some times, it's not you, it's them. Not limited to the tab-based statistics, you can request to see the internal statistics by the browser. Reveals all the standard allocations for the browser, in addition to a hierarchical view of all memory used by your particular sessions.

### What's in the pipeline

* A tracker which would allow you to selectively compare datasets across time
* Ability to store a basic data-dump
* A beautiful page for the beautiful stats
